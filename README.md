# ArduinoWatch
I'm trying to make an Arduino watch with just PCBs!
You know it's hard to make a shell for the DIY projects.
Some one use 3D printer to make shells.
But it's heavy weight and expensive.
So I came up with a good idea when I was trying to design my Arduino watch.
Use the PCBs acting as the shell.

The project is in very beginning.
